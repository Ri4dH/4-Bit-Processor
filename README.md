#4-Bit-Processor

This project is a functional 4-bit CPU architecture built from the ground up using fundamental logic gates in the Digital simulator. Developed for CIS 310 (Computer Organization) at the University of Michigan–Dearborn, it simulates a complete fetch-decode-execute cycle by coordinating hardware-level data flow through custom-designed components including a 4-bit ALU, Program Counter, and Instruction Memory.

The design is fully modular, featuring integrated sub-circuits for DRAM (4x16), a register file, and control logic units designed to ensure precise signal synchronization. To view the architecture in action, load the 4-bit processor.dig file into the Digital logic simulator to observe real-time instruction execution and hardware-level state changes across the entire data path.
